                   The fantastic combinations of John
                   Conway's new solitaire game "life"
 
                          by Martin Gardner
 
    Most of the work of John Horton Conway, a mathematician at
    Gonville and Caius College of the University of Cambridge,
    has been in pure mathematics. For instance, in 1967 he discovered
    a new group - some call it "Conway's constellation" - that
    includes all but two of the then known sporadic groups.
    (They are called "sporadic" because they fail to fit any
    classification scheme.) It is a breakthrough that has had
    exciting repercussions in both group theory and number theory.
    It ties in closely with an earlier discovery by John Leech of an
    extremely dense packing of unit spheres in a space of 24
    dimensions where each sphere touches 196,560 others. As Conway
    has remarked, "There is a lot of room up there."
      In addition to such serious work Conway also enjoys recreational
    mathematics. Although he is highly productive in this field, he
    seldom publishes his discoveries. One exception was his paper on
    "Mrs. Perkins' Quilt," a dissection problem discussed in
    "Mathematical Games" for September, 1966. My topic for July, 1967,
    was sprouts, a topological pencil-and-paper game invented by
    Conway and M. S. Paterson. Conway has been mentioned here several
    other times.
      This month we consider Conway's latest brainchild, a fantastic
    solitaire pastime he calls "life." Because of its analogies with
    the rise, fall and alterations of a society of living organisms,
    it belongs to a growing class of what are called "simulation games"
    - games that resemble real-life processes. To play life you must
    have a fairly large checkerboard and a plentiful supply of flat
    counters of two colors. (Small checkers or poker chips do nicely.)
    An Oriental "go" board can be used if you can find flat counters
    that are small enough to fit within its cells. (Go stones are
    unusable because they are not flat.) It is possible to work with
    pencil and graph paper but it is much easier, particularly for
    beginners, to use counters and a board.<2/27>
      The basic idea is to start with a simple configuration of
    counters (organisms), one to a cell, then observe how it changes
    as you apply Conway's "genetic laws" for births, deaths and
    survivals. Conway chose his rules carefully, after a long period
    of experimentation, to meet three desiredata:
      1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a
    simple proof that the population can grow without limit.
      2. There should be initial patterns that *apparently* do grow
    without limit.
      3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change
    for a considerable period of time before coming to an end in three
    possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or from
    becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that
    remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in
    which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.
      In brief, the rules should be such as to make the behavior of
    the population unpredictable.
      Conway's genetic laws are delightfully simple. First note that
    each cell of the checkerboard (assumed to be an infinite plane)
    has eight neighboring cells, four adjacent orthogonally, four
    adjacent diagonally. The rules are:
      1. Survivals. Every counter with two or three neighboring
    counters survives for the next generation.
      2. Deaths. Each counter with four or more neighbors dies
    (is removed) from overpopulation. Every counter with one neighbor
    or none dies from isolation.
      3. Births. Each empty cell adjacent to exactly three neighbors
    - no more, no fewer - is a birth cell. A counter is placed on it
    at the next move.
      It is important to understand that all births and deaths occur
    *simultaneously*. Together they constitute a single generation or,
    as we shall call it, a "move" in the complete "life history" of
    the initial configuration. Conway recommends the following
    procedure for making the moves:
      1. Start with a pattern consisting of black counters.
      2. Locate all counters that will die. Identify them by putting
    a black counter on top of each.
      3. Locate all vacant cells where births will occur. Put a white
    counter on each birth cell.
      4. After the pattern has been checked and double-checked to make
    sure no mistakes have been made, remove all the dead counters
    (piles of two) and replace all newborn white organisms with black
    counters.
      You will now have the first generation in the life history of
    your initial pattern. The same procedure is repeated to produce
    subsequent generations. It should be clear why counters of two
    colors are needed. Because births and deaths occur simultaneously,
    newborn counters play no role in causing other deaths or births.
    It is essential, therefore, to be able to distinguish them from
    live counters of the previous generation while you check the
    pattern to be sure no errors have been made. Mistakes are very
    easy to make, particularly when first playing the game. After
    playing it for a while you will gradually make fewer mistakes,
    but even experienced players must exercise great care in checking
    every new generation before removing the dead counters and
    replacing newborn white counters with black.<3/27>
      You will find the population constantly undergoing unusual,
    sometimes beautiful and alway unexpected change. In a few cases
    the society eventually dies out (all counters vanishing), although
    this may not happen until after a great many generations. Most
    starting patterns either reach stable figures - Conway calls them
    "still lifes" - that cannot change or patterns that oscillate
    forever. Patterns with no initial symmetry tend to become
    symmetrical. Once this happens the symmetry cannot be lost,
    although it may increase in richness.
      Conway conjectures that no pattern can grow without limit.
    Put another way, any configuration with a finite number of
    counters cannot grow beyond a finite upper limit to the number
    of counters on the field. This is probably the deepest and most
    difficult question posed by the game. Conway has offered a prize
    of $50 to the first person who can prove or disprove the conjecture
    before the end of the year. One way to disprove it would be to
    discover patterns that keep adding counters to the field: a "gun"
    (a configuration that repeatedly shoots out moving objects such
    as the "glider," to be explained below) or a "puffer train"
    (a configuration that moves but leaves behind a trail of "smoke").
    I shall forward all proofs to Conway, who will act as the final
    arbiter of the contest.
      Let us see what happens to a variety of simple patterns.
      A single organism or any pair of counters, wherever placed,
    will obviously vanish on the first move.
      A beginning pattern of three counters also dies immediately
    unless at least one counter has two neighbors. The illustration
    below shows the five triplets that do not fade on the first move.
    (Their orientation is of course irrelevant.)

      The first three [a, b, c] vanish on the second move. In
    connection with c it is worth noting that a single diagonal chain
    of counters, howewer long, loses its end counters on each move
    until the chain finally disappears. The speed a chess king moves in
    any direction is called by Conway (for reasons to be made clear
    later) the "speed of light." We say, therefore, that a diagonal
    chain decays at each end with the speed of light.
      Pattern d becomes a stable "block" (two-by-two square) on the
    second move. Pattern e is the simplest of what are called
    "flip-flops" (oscillating figures of period 2). It alternates
    between horizontal and vertical rows of three. Conway callls it
    a "blinker."

      The illustration above shows the life histories of the five
    tetrominoes (four rookwise-connected counters). The square <a> is,
    as we have seen, a still-life figure. Tetrominoes b and c reach a
    stable figure, called a "beehive," on the second move. Beehives
    are frequently produced patterns. Tetromino d becomes a beehive
    on the third move. Tetromino e is the most interesting of the lot.
    After nine moves it becomes four isolated blinkers, a flip-flop
    called "traffic lights." It too is a common configuration. The
    illustration below shows the 12 commonest forms of still life.

      The reader may enjoy experimenting with the 12 pentominoes
    (all patterns of five rookwise-connected counters) to see what
    happens to each. He will find that five vanish before the fifth
    move, two quickly reach a stable pattern of seven counters and
    four in a short times become traffic lights. The only pentomino
    that does not end quickly (by vanishing, becoming stable or
    oscillating) is the R pentomino ("a" in the illustration at the
    bottom of this page). Its fate is not yet known. Conway has
    tracked it for 460 moves. By then it has thrown off a number
    of gliders. Conway remarks: "It has left a lot of miscellaneous
    junk stagnating around, and has only a few small active regions,
    so it is not at all obvious that it will continue indefinitely.
    After 48 moves it has become a figure of seven counters on the
    left and two symmetric regions on the right which, if undisturbed,
    would grow into a honey farm (four beehives) and traffic lights.
    However, the honey farm gets eaten into pretty quickly and the
    four blinkers forming the traffic lights disappear one by one
    into the rest of a rather blotchy population."
      For long-lived populations such as this one Conway sometimes
    uses a PDP 7 computer with a screen on which he can observe the
    changes. The program was written by M. J. T. Guy and S. R. Bourne.
    Without its help some discoveries about the game would have been
    difficult to make.
      As easy exercises to be answered next month the reader is
    invited to discover the fate of the Latin cross ("b" in the
    illustration at the bottom of this page), the swastika (c),
    the letter H (d), the beacon (c), the clock (f), the toad (g)
    and the pinwheel (h). The last three figures were discovered
    by Simon Norton. If the center counter of the H is moved up one
    cell to make an arch (Conway calls it "pi"), the change is
    unexpectedly drastic. The H quickly ends but pi has a long
    history. Not until after 173 moves has it settled down to five
    blinkers, six blocks and two ponds. Conway also has tracked the
    life histories of all the hexominoes, and all but seven of the
    heptominoes.

      One of the most remarkable of Conway's discoveries is the
    five-counter glider shown in the illustration above. After
    two moves it has shifted slightly and been reflected in
    a diagonal line. Geometers call this a "glide reflection";
    hence the figure's name. After two more moves the glider has
    righted itself and moved one cell diagonally down and to the
    right from its initial position. We mentioned above that the
    speed of a chess king is called the speed of light. Conway chose
    the phrase because it is the highest speed at which any kind
    of movement can occur on the board. No pattern can replicate
    itself rapidly enough to move at such speed. Conway has proved
    that maximum speed diagonally is a fourth the speed of light.
    Since the glider replicates itself in the same orientation after
    four moves, and has traveled one cell diagonally, one says that
    it glides across the field at a fourth the speed of light.
      Movement of a finite figure horizontally or vertically into
    empty space, Conway has also shown, cannot exceed half the speed
    of light. Can any reader find a relatively simple figure that
    travels at such a speed? Remember, the speed is obtained by
    dividing the number of moves required to replicate a figure by
    the number of cells it has shifted. If a figure replicates in
    four moves in the same orientation after traveling two unit
    squares horizontally or vertically, its speed will be half that
    of light. I shall report later on any discoveries by readers of
    any figures that crawl across the board in any direction at any
    speed, however low. Figures that move in this way are extremely
    hard to find. Conway knows of only four, including the glider,
    which he calls "spaceships" (the glider is a "featherweight
    spaceship"; the others have more counters). He has asked me to
    keep three heavier spaceships secret as a challenge to readers.
    Readers are also urged to search for periodic figures other than
    the ones given here.
      The bottom illustration on this page depicts three beautiful
    discoveries by Conway and his collaborators. the stable honey
    farm ("a" in the illustration) results after 14 moves from a
    horizontal row of seven counters. Since a five-by-five block
    in one move produces the fourth generation of this life history,
    it becomes a honey farm after 11 moves. The "figure 8" (b), an
    oscillator found by Norton, both resembles an 8 and has a period
    of 8. The form c, called "pulsar CP 48-56-72," is an oscillator
    with a life cycle of period 3. The state shown here has 48
    counters, state two has 56 and state three has 72, after which
    the pulsar returns to 48 again. It is generated in 32 moves by
    a heptomino consisting of a horizontal row of five counters with
    one counter directly below each end counter of the row.

      Conway has tracked the life histories of a row of n counters
    through n = 20. We have already disclosed what happens through
    n = 4. Five counters result in traffic lights, six fade away,
    seven produce the honey farm, eight end with four blocks and
    four beehives, nine produce two sets of traffic lights, and 10
    lead to the "pentadecathlon," with a life cycle of period 15.
    Eleven counters produce two blinkers, 12 end with two beehives,
    13 with two blinkers, 14 and 15 vanish, 16 give "big traffic
    lights" (eight blinkers), 17 end with four blocks, 18 and 19
    fade away and 20 generate two blocks.
      Rows consisting of sets of five counters, an empty cell
    separating adjacent sets, have also been tracked by Conway.
    The 5-5 row generates the pulsar CP 48-56-72 in 21 moves, 5-5-5
    ends as four blocks and two blinkers, 5-5-5-5 ends with four
    honey farms and four blinkers, 5-5-5-5-5 terminates with a
    "spectacular display of eight gliders and eight blinkers.
    Then the gliders crash in pairs to become eight blocks."
    The form 5-5-5-5-5-5 ends with four blinkers, and 5-5-5-5-5-5-5,
    Conway remarks, "is marvelous to sit watching on the computer
    screen." He has yet to track it to its ultimate destiny, however.

    Last month's exercises, involving John Horton Conway's game
    "life," are answered as follows:
      The Latin cross dies on the fifth move. The swastika vanishes
    on the sixth move. The letter H dies on the sixth move. The next
    three figures are flip-flops: as Conway writes, "The toad pants,
    the clock ticks and the beacon flashes, with period 2 in every
    case." The pinwheel's interior rotates 90 degrees clockwise on
    each move, the rest of the pattern remaining stable. Periodic
    figures of this kind, in which a fixed outer border is required
    to move the interior, Conway calls "billiard-table configurations"
    to distinguish them from "naturally periodic" figures such as the
    toad, clock and beacon.

      The three known spaceships (in addition to the glider, or
    "featherweight spaceship," given last month) are shown in the
    illustration above. All three travel horizontally to the right
    with half the speed of light. As they move they throw off sparks
    that vanish immediately as the ships continue on their way.
    Unescorted spaceships cannot have bodies longer than six counters
    without giving birth to objects that later block their motion.
    Conway has discovered, however, that longer spaceships, which he
    calls "overweight" ones, can be escorted by two or more smaller
    ships that prevent the formation of blocking counters. The
    illustration below shows the longest spaceship that can be
    escorted by as few as two smaller ships; still longer ships
    require a flotilla of more than two companions. A spaceship
    with a body of 100 counters, Conway finds, can be escorted
    safely by a flotilla of 33 smaller ships.
      I shall report later on any success readers have in finding
    new spaceships or oscillators or in meeting Conway's challenge
    to settle his conjecture about the game.

      Next month this department will be devoted to "cellular
    automata theory," a new field that includes John Horton Conway's
    game "life," the topic for last October. I shall report then on
    what readers have discovered about Conway's game and sketch the
    historical background for games of this type. Meanwhile I am
    pleased to report that two unresolved questions in October's
    column have been settled: the final destinies of the R pentomino
    and the 5-5-5-5-5-5-5 row (seven sets of five counters on the
    same orthogonal row, with single vacant cells separating the
    sets).
      The R pentomino reaches a "steady state" after move 1103. Six
    gliders have been produced and are traveling outward. The debris
    left at the center (see illustration on page 105 <sorry, not
    reproduced here>) consists of four blinkers, one ship, one boat,
    one loaf, four beehives and eight blocks. This was first
    established at Case Western Reserve University with a computer
    program written by Gary Filipski and Brad Morgan; the results
    were sent to me by Ranan B. Banerji, professor of engineering.
    At the time of writing later confirmations have been received
    from Jonathan Kring, North Olmstead, Ohio; Robert Slaughter,
    University on Nebraska Computing Center; D. M. Saul, University
    of Illinois; George A Miller, Rockville, Md. (who supplied the
    graph reproduced here), Robert Bison, IBM Corporation, Kingston,
    N.Y.; Robert Maas, Mountain View, Calif.; Leonard A Adleman,
    San Francisco; Eric Werne, Carnegie-Mellon University; Maynard C.
    Cheney, University of Chigaco, and group at Honeywell's Computer
    Control Division in Framingham, Mass., that includes Keith
    McClelland, Tom Holmes, Mike Sporer, Bill Woods and Don Woods.
      The fate of the 5-5-5-5-5-5-5 was independently found at about
    the same time by the Honeywell group cited above, by D. M. Saul
    and by Robert T. Wainwright, Yorktown Heights, N.Y. The pattern
    stabilizes after move 323 with four traffic lights, eight
    blinkers, eight loaves, eight beehives and four blocks - a total
    of 192 bits. The printout of this spectacular end result (see
    illustration on page 106 <not reproduced here either>) was
    supplied by Wainwright. Because symmetry cannot be lost in the
    life histories of any initial pattern, the vertical and
    horizontal axes of symmetry of the original figure are preserved
    in the final configuration. The maximum population (492 bits)
    occurs in generation 283.
      Although I did not say so before, it should be apparent that
    rows of the n-n-n... type become interesting only when n is at
    least 5, which allows the sets to interact. Rows of 1-1-1...
    and 2-2-2... immediately vanish. The 3-3-3... row is simply a
    row of blinkers and the 4-4-4... becomes a row of stable beehives
    on the second move.

                          MATHEMATICAL GAMES
 
                On cellular automata, self-reproduction,
                 the Garden of Eden and the game "life"
 
                          by Martin Gardner
 
      John Horton Conway's game "life," last October's topic,
    stirred such interest among computer scientists that this
    month's department will again be devoted to the game. Before
    reporting as many new discoveries as possible I should like
    to discuss some highlights in the history of "cellular automata
    theory," the field in which games similar to Conway's are being
    investigated.
      It all began about 1950, when John von Neumann set himself the
    task of proving the possibility of self-duplicating automata.
    Such a machine, given proper instructions, would build an exact
    duplicate of itself. Each of the two machines would then build
    another, the four would become eight, and so on. (This
    proliferation of self-replicating automata is the basis of Lord
    Dunsany's amusing 1951 novel The Last Revolution.) Von Neumann
    first proved his case with "kinematic" models of a machine that
    could roam through a warehouse of parts, select needed components
    and put together a copy of itself. Later, adopting an inspired
    suggestion by his friend Stanislaw M. Ulam, he showed the
    possibility of such machines in a more elegant and abstract way.
      Von Neumann's new proof used what is now called a "uniform
    cellular space" equivalent to an infinite checkerboard. Each
    cell can have any finite number of "states," including a
    "quiescent" (or empty) state, and a finite set of "neighbor"
    cells that can influence its state. The pattern of states
    changes in discrete time steps according to a set of "transition
    rules" that apply simultaneously to every cell. The cells
    symbolize the basic parts of a finite-state automaton and a
    configuration of live cells is an idealized model of such a
    machine. Conway's game is based on just such a space. His
    neighborhood consists of the eight cells surrounding a cell;
    each cell has two states (empty or filled), and his transition
    rules are the birth, death and survival rules I explained in
    October. Von Neumann, applying transition rules to a space in
    which each cell has 29 states and four orthogonally adjacent
    neighbors, proved the existence of a configuration of about
    200 000 cells that would self-reproduce.
      The reason for such an enormous configuration is that, for
    von Neumann's proof to apply to actual automata, it was necessary
    that his cellular space be capable of simulating a Turing
    machine: an idealized automaton, named for its inventor, the
    British mathematician A. M. Turing, capable of performing any
    desired calculation. By embedding this universal computer in
    his configuration, von Neumann was able to produce a universal
    constructor. Because it could in principle construct any desired
    configuration by stretching "arms" into an empty region of the
    cellular space, it would self-replicate when given a blueprint
    of itself. Since von Neumann's death in 1957 his existence proof
    (the actual configuration is too vast to construct and manipulate)
    has been greatly simplified. The latest and best reduction, by
    Edwin Roger Banks, a mechanical engineering graduate student at
    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, does the job with the
    cells of only four states.<13/27>
      Self-replication in a trivial sense - without using
    configurations that contain Turing machines - is easy to achieve.
    A delightfully simple example, discovered by Edward Fredkin of
    M.I.T. about 10 years ago, uses two-state cells, the von Neumann
    neighborhood of four orthogonally adjacent cells and the
    following parity rule: Each cell with an even number of live
    neighbors (0, 2, 4) at time t becomes or remains empty at time
    t+1, and each cell with an odd number of neighbors (1, 3) at time
    t becomes or remains live at time t+1. It is not hard to show
    that after 2^n moves (n varying with different patterns) any
    initial pattern of live cells will reproduce itself four times
    - above, below, left and right of an empty space that it formerly
    occupied. The four replicas will be displaced 2^n cells from
    the vanished original. The new pattern will, of course, replicate
    again after another 2^n steps, so that the duplicates keep
    quadrupling in the endless series 1, 4, 16, 64, .... The
    illustration below shows two quadruplings of a right tromino.
    Terry Winograd, in a 1967 term paper written when he was an
    M.I.T. student, generalized Fredkin's rule to other neighborhoods,
    any number of dimensions and cells with any prime number of
    states.

      Ulam investigated a variety of cellular automata games,
    experimenting with different neighborhoods, numbers of states
    and transition rules. In a 1967 paper "On Recursively Defined
    Geometrical Objects and Patterns of Growth," written with Robert
    G. Schrandt, Ulam described a number of different games. The
    upper illustration on this page (113) <sorry, not reproduced>
    shows generation 45 of a history that began with one counter
    on the central cell. As in Conway's game, the cells are
    two-state, but the neighborhood is that of von Neumann
    (four adjacent orthogonal cells). Births occur on cells
    that have one and only one neighbor, and all live cells
    of generation n vanish when generation n+2 is born. In other
    words, only the last two generation survive at any step. In
    the illustration the 444 new births are shown as black cells.
    The 404 white cells of the preceding generation will all
    disappear on the next move. Note the characteristic subpattern,
    which Ulam calls a "dog bone." Ulam experimented with games in
    which two configurations were allowed to grow until they
    collided. In the ensuing "battle" one side would sometimes wipe
    out the other; sometimes both armies would be annihilated. Ulam
    also explored games on three-dimensional cubical tessellations.
    His major papers on cellular automata are in Essays on Cellular
    Automata (University of Illinois Press, 1970), edited by Arthur
    W. Burks.
      Similar games can be devised for triangular and hexagonal
    tessellations but, although they *look* different, they are not
    essentially so. All can be translated into equivalent games on
    a square tessellation by a suitable definition of "neighborhood."
    A neighborhood need not be made up of touching cells. In chess,
    for instance, a knight's neighborhood consists of the squares to
    which it can leap and squares on which there are pieces that can
    attack it. As Burks has pointed out, games such as chess,
    checkers and go can be regarded as cellular automata games in
    which there are complicated neighborhoods and transition rules
    and in which players choose among alternative next states in an
    attempt to be first to reach a certain final state that wins.
      Among the notable contributions of Edward F. Moore to cellular
    automata theory the best-known is a technique for proving the
    existence of what John W. Tukey named "Garden of Eden" patterns.
    These are configurations that cannot arise in a game because no
    preceding generation can form them. They appear only if given in
    the initial (zero) generation. Because such a configuration has
    no predecessor, it cannot be self-reproducing. I shall not
    describe Moore's ingenious technique because he explained it
    informally in an article in this magazine (see "Mathematics in
    the Biological Sciences," by Edward F. Moore; September, 1964)
    and more formally in a paper that is included in Burk's anthology.<15/27>
      Alvy Ray Smith III, a cellular automata expert at New York
    University's School of Engineering and Science, found a simple
    application of Moore's technique to Conway's game. Consider two
    five-by-five squares, one with all cells empty, the other with
    one counter in the center. Because, in one move, the central
    nine cells of both squares are certain to become identical
    (in this case all cells empty) they are said to be "mutually
    erasable." It follows from Moore's theorem that a Garden of Eden
    configuration must exist in Conway's game. Unfortunately the
    proof does not tell how to find such a pattern and so far none
    is known. It may be simple or it may be enormously complex.
    Using one of the Moore's formulas, Smith has been able to
    calculate that such a pattern exists within a square of 10
    billion cells on a side, which does not help much in finding one.
      Smith has been working on cellular automata that simulate
    pattern-recognition machines. Although this is now only of
    theoretical interest, the time may come when robots will need
    "retinas" for recognizing patterns. The speeds of scanning
    devices are slow compared with the speeds obtainable by the
    "parallel computation" of animal retinas, which simultaneously
    transmit thousands of messages to the brain. Parallel computation
    is the only way new computers can increase significantly in speed
    because without it they are limited by the speed of light through
    miniaturized circuitry (see "The Fastest Computer," by  D. L.
    Slotnick, page 76). The cover of this issue of SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN
    shows a simple procedure, devised by Smith, by which a finite
    one-dimensional cellular space employs parallel computation for
    recognizing palindromic symmetry. Each cell has many possible
    states, the number depending on the number of different symbols
    in the palindrome, and a cell's neighborhood is the two cells on
    each side.

      On the cover, which Smith designed, he symbolizes the palindrome
    TOO HOT TO HOOT with four states of cells in the top row, T, O and
    H are represented by blue, red and yellow respectively <but here
    the corresponding letters are used instead>, and black <here the
    character '#'> marks the palindrome's two ends. The white cells 
    <blanks> in the other rows are in the quiescent state. The
    horizontal rows below the top row are successive generations of
    the top configuration when certain transition rules are followed
    in discrete time steps. In other words, the picture is a
    space-time diagram of a single row, each successive row
    indicating the next generation.
      In the first transition each color travels one cell to the left
    and one cell to the right, except for the end colors, which are
    blocked by black; black moves inward at each step. Each cell on
    which two colors land acquires a new state, symbolized by a cell
    divided into four triangles. The left triangle has the color that
    was previously on the left, the right triangle has the color
    previously on the right. The result of this first move is shown
    in the second row. When an adjacent pair of cells forms a tilted
    square in the center that is a solid color, it indicates a
    "collision" of like colors and is symbolized by black dots in the
    two white triangles of the left cell <here the colon ':' is used>.
    Dots remain in that cell for all subsequent generations unless a
    collission of unlike colors occurs to the immediate right of the
    dotted cell, in which case the dots are erased. When collisions
    of *unlike* colors occur, the left cell of the pair remains
    undotted for all subsequent generations even though like colors
    may later collide on its right. At each move the colors continue
    to travel one cell left or right (the direction in which the
    colored triangles point) and all rules apply. If the palindrome
    has n letters, with n even as in this example (the scheme is
    modified slightly if n is odd), it is easy to see that after n/2
    moves only two adjacent nonquiescent cells remain. If the left
    cell of this pair is dotted, the automaton has recognized the
    initial row as being palindromic. Down the diagram's center you
    see the colliding pairs of like colors in the same order as they
    appear on the palindrome from the center to each end. As soon as
    recognition occurs the left cell of the last pair is erased
    and the right cell is altered to an "accept" state, here
    symbolized by nested squares. An undotted left cell would
    signal a nonpalindrome, in which case the left cell would
    become blank and the right cell would go into a "reject" state.
      A Turing machine, which computes serially, requires in general
    n^2 steps to recognize a palindrome of length n. Although
    recognition occurs here at step n/2, the accept state is shown
    moving in subsequent generations to the right to symbolize the
    cell-by-cell transmission of the acceptance to an output boundary
    of the cellular space. Of course it is easy to construct more
    efficient palindrome-recognizing devices with actual electronic
    hardware, but the point here is to do it with a highly abstract,
    one-dimensional cellular space in which information can pass
    only from a cell to adjacent cells and not even the center of
    the initial series of symbols is known at the outset. As Smith
    puts it anthropomorphically, after the first step each of the
    three dotted cells thinks it is at the center of a palindrome.
    The dotted cells at each end are disillusioned on the next move
    because of the collission of unlike colors at their right. Not
    until generation n/2 does the dotted cell at the center know it
    actually *is* at the center.<17/27>
      Now for some startling new results concerning Conway's game.
    Conway was fully aware of earlier games and it was with them in
    mind that he selected his recursive rules with great care to
    avoid two extremes: too many patterns that grow quickly without
    limit and too many that fade quickly. By striking a delicate
    balance he designed a game of surprising unpredictability and
    one that produced such remarkable figures as oscillators and
    moving spaceships. He conjectured that no finite population
    could grow (in number of members) without limit, and he offered
    $50 for the first proof or disproof. The prize was won in
    November by a group in the Artificial Intelligence Project at
    M.I.T. consisting of (in alphabetical order) Robert April,
    Michael Beeler, R. William Gosper, Jr., Richard Howell, Rich
    Schroeppel and Michael Speciner. Using a program devised by
    Speciner for displaying moves on an oscilloscope, Gosper made
    a truly astounding discovery: he found a glider gun! The
    configuration shown below grows into such a gun, firing its
    first glider on move 40. The gun is an oscillator of period
    30 that ejects a new glider every 30 moves. Since each glider
    adds five more counters to the field, the population obviously
    grows without limit.

      The glider gun led the M.I.T. group to many other amazing
    discoveries. A series of printouts (supplied by Robert T.
    Wainwright of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.) shows how 13 gliders crash
    to form a glider gun (see illustration on page 117) <sorry, too
    hard to reproduce it here>. The last five printouts show the gun
    in full action. The group also found a way to position a
    pentadecathlon (see illustration below), an oscillator of
    period 15, so that it "eats" every glider that strikes it.
    A pentadecathlon can also reflect a glider 180 degrees, making
    it possible for two pentadecathlons to shuttle a glider back
    and forth forever. Streams of intersecting gliders produce
    fantastic results. Strange patterns can be created that in
    turn emit gliders. Sometimes collision configurations grow
    until they ingest all guns. In other cases the collision mass
    destroys one or more guns by shooting back. The group's latest
    burst of virtuosity is a way of placing guns so that the
    intersecting streams of gliders build a factory that assembles
    and fires a lightweight spaceship every 300 moves.

      The existence of glider guns raises the exciting possibility
    that Conway's game will allow the simulation of a Turing machine,
    a universal calculator capable in principle of doing anything the
    most powerful computer can do. The trick would be to use gliders
    as unit pulses for storing and transmitting information and
    performing the required logic operations that are handled in
    actual computers by their circuitry. If Conway's game allows a
    universal calculator, the next question will be whether it allows
    a universal constructor, from which nontrivial self-replication
    would follow. So far this has not been achieved with a two-state
    space and Conway's neighborhood, although it has been proved
    impossible with two states and the von Neumann neighborhood.<19/27>
      The M.I.T. group found many new oscillators (see illustration
    below). One of them, the barber pole, can be stretched to any
    length and is a flip-flop, with each state a mirror image of the
    other. Another, which they rediscovered, is a pattern Conway's
    group had found earlier and called a Hertz oscillator. Every
    four moves the colored "bit" switches from one side of the
    central frame to the other, making it an oscillator of period 8.
    The tumbler, which was found by George D. Collins, Jr., of
    McLean, Va., turns upside down every seven moves.

      The Cheshire cat (see illustration below) was discovered by
    C.R. Tompkins of Corona, Calif. On the sixth move the face
    vanishes, leaving only a grin; the grin fades on the next move
    and only a permanent paw print (block) remains. The harvester
    was constructed by David W. Poyner of Basildon in England. It
    plows up an infinite diagonal at the speed of light, oscillating
    with period 4 and ejecting stable packages along the way (see
    illustration below). "Unfortunately," writes Poyner, "I have
    been unable to develop a propagator that will sow as fast as
    the harvester will reap."
 
    The Cheshire cat (0) fades to a grin (6) and disappears,
    leaving a paw print(7).

      Wainwright has made a number of intriguing investigations.
    He filled a 120-by-120 square field with 4,800 randomly placed
    bits (a density of one-third) and tracked their history for 450
    generations, by which time the density of this primordial soup,
    as Wainwright calls it, had thinned steadily to one-sixth.
    Whether it would eventually vanish or, as Wainwright says,
    percolate at a constant minimum density is anybody's guess.
    At any rate, during the 450 generations 42 short-lived gliders
    were formed. Wainwright found 14 different patterns that became
    glider states on the next move. The pattern that produced the
    greatest number of gliders (14 in all <???>) is shown ("a" in
    illustration below). A Z-pattern found by Collins and by
    Jeffrey Lund of Pewaukee, Wis., after 12 moves becomes two
    gliders that sail off in opposite directions (b). Wainwright
    and others set two gliders on a collission course that causes
    all bits to vanish on the fourth move (c). Wallace W. Wagner
    of Anaheim, Calif., found a collission course for two lightweight
    spaceships that also ends (on the seventh move) in total
    blankness (d).

      Wainwright has experimented with various infinite fields of
    regular stable patterns, which he call agars-rich culture
    mediums. When, for instance, a single "virus", or bit, is placed
    in the agar of blocks shown in the illustration below so that it
    touches the corners of four blocks, the agar eliminates the virus
    and repairs itself in two moves. If, however, the alien bit is
    positioned as shown (or at any of the seven other symmetrically
    equivalent spots), it initiates an inexorable disintegration
    of the pattern. The portion eaten away contains active debris
    that has overall bilateral symmetry along one axis and a roughly
    oval border that expands, probably forever, in the four compass
    directions at the speed of light.

      The most immediate practical application of automata theory,
    Banks believes, is likely to be in the design of circuits capable
    of self-repair or the wiring of any specified type of new circuit.
    No one can say how significant the theory may eventually become
    for the physical and biological sciences. It may have important
    bearings on cell growth in embryos, the replication of DNA
    molecules, the operation of nerve nets, genetic changes in
    evolving populations and so on. Analogies with life processes
    are impossible to resist. If a primordial broth of amino acids
    is large enough, and there is sufficient time, self-replicating,
    moving automata may result from complex transition rules built
    into the structure of matter and the laws of nature. There is
    even the possibility that spacetime itself is granular, composed
    of discrete units, and that the universe, as Fredkin and others
    have suggested, is a cellular automaton run by an enormous
    computer. If so, what we call motion may be only simulated
    motion. A moving spaceship, on the ultimate microlevel, may
    be essentially the same as one of Conway's spaceships, appearing
    to move on the macrolevel whereas actually there is only an
    alteration of states of basic space-stime cells in obedience to
    transition rules that have not yet been discovered.

      John Horton Conway and R. William Gosper, Jr. (who with the
    aid of his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    found the glider gun described last month), have independently
    succeeded in "universalizing" the cellular space of Conway's
    "life" game. By using gliders as pulses they were able to
    simulate a Turing machine and create a universal calculator.
    Gosper's group has also found ways of forming giant flip-flops
    such as the one shown on the opposite page (108) <sorry, too
    hard to reproduce>, which oscillates between the patterns shown
    in black and in color.

      February's column showed a figure called the harvester, in
    John Horton Conway's game of "life", that plows up an infinite
    diagonal of bits, depositing them in stable blocks. Keith
    McClelland and his associates Thomas Holmes, Michael Sporer,
    Philip Stanley, Donal Woods and William Woods in the Computer
    Control Division of Honeywell Inc., in Framingham, Mass.,
    have investigated a variety of figures of this type that they
    call "fuses". The simplest fuse is a diagonal of bits that rises
    to infinity or has a stable top end ("a" in illustration given
    below). It simply burns out without producing sparks or smoke.
    Another smokeless fuse oscillates with a period of four, giving
    off sparks that quickly fade (b). A dirty fuse leaves behind
    clouds of debris as it burns (c). The "baker" is what McClelland
    calls a "confused fuse": it bakes a string of stable loaves (d).

      The group also tracked the life histories of the first nine
    members of the five-cell-cross series, of which the first four
    orders are shown in the illustration given below. Order-1 is a
    small portion of an infinite trellis found by Donald Woods:
    solid horizontal and vertical rows with two-cell spacing between.
    Like the trellis, it vanishes completely in one move. The order-2
    cross dies in eight generations. Order-3 ends with many traffic
    lights. Order-4 stabilizes with eight blinkers after 34 moves,
    making a spectacular display along the way. Its 19th generation
    is a ring of blocks with a perfect checkerboard in the center.
    Order-5 and order-7 go to four pulsars, order-6 and order-8 go
    to four pulsars and a tub, and order-9 ends after 42 moves with
    16 blocks and eight blinkers.

      Two new glider-generators have been found by the Honeywell
    group (see illustration above). The "biloaf" (left) in four
    moves produces two gliders going opposite ways, and the 4-8-12
    diamond (right) in 15 moves forms four gliders "headed for the
    four corners of the earth". No debris is left by either generator.
    Space prevents giving other unusual configurations discovered by
    the Honeywell group, or details of a two-person "life" game
    devised by Donald Woods. (Many readers have sent in such games,
    with widely varying rules.) Readers interested in keeping up with
    new "life" developments should contact Robert T. Wainwright at
    1280 Edcris Road in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. 10598. He is planning

    body of information concerning all aspects of Conway's remarkable
    cellular-automata game.

      A remarkable seven-bit stable figure in Conway's game "life"
    has been discovered by R. William Gosper, Jr., and his associates
    at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Called "the eater",
    it is capable of eating a large variety of "life" forms and then
    quickly repairing itself. The first four patterns in the
    illustration belove show the eater about to ingest a glider (1),
    a blinker (2), a pre-beehive (3) and a lightweight spaceship (4).
    In the fifth pattern two eaters are poised to eat each other (5).
    This is prevented by their amazing self-repairing ability,
    creating what is probably the smallest oscillating pattern,
    with a rare period of 3. The last pattern shows how two gliders
    collide to produce an eater in 13 moves (6).
